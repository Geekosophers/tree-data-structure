# About the Project
The project is a part of the Series Visualizing the Code with Geekosophers which is designed to give users the ability to visualize different algorithms.

**Brief about the series-** It is an initiative taken by us to bring the world of algorithms closer to the tech enthusiasts by helping them visualize the algorithms. Join us in this journey where we will be covering a wide range of algorithms from Simple Binary search to complex Data Structure and Algorithms.

# Tree Data Structure
This repo contains the animation codes for different Tree related problems.

## Binary Search Tree- 
### 1. Finding node with minimum value in BST
